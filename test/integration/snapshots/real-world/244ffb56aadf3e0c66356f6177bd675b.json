Most people didn't take the announcement seriously given the day and the fact that people have been clamoring for an edit button for years now, but Twitter today confirmed that the work on the edit button is real. \n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nTwitter plans to test the edit feature with Twitter Blue subscribers. Twitter Blue is priced at $3 per month and provides users with early access to new features and other perks.

				"description": "Apple today seeded the first betas of iOS 15.5 and iPadOS 15.5 to developers after a three week long wait following the launch of iOS 15.4 and iPadOS 15.4. The new updates aren't as feature rich as the prior updates and focus primarily on under-the-hood changes, but there are still a few minor tweaks, which we've outlined below.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/iOS-15.5-Version-Feature-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-842156\" />\n<br/>\n<h2>Apple Classical References</h2>\n<br/>\nThere are references to the upcoming \"Apple Classical\" app that Apple has in development to complement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, suggesting the standalone app could soon see a launch. There are \"Open in Apple Classical\" and \"Open this in the new app designed for classical music\" in the Music app code, but the Classical app has not yet launched.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/apple-classical-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1834\" height=\"498\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-842149\" />\n<br/>\nApple acquired classical music streaming service Primephonic <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-service/\">back in August 2021</a> and said that it would be building a new classical music experience for ‌Apple Music‌. Apple is planning to launch a new standalone app dedicated to classical music, and the app will combine Primephonic's user interface and specializations for classical music with ‌‌Apple Music‌‌ and features such as Lossless and Spatial Audio. Apple has not provided details on when the app might come out, but preparations are clearly being made. \n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<h2>Apple Pay Cash</h2>\n<br/>\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> Cash section of the Wallet app, there are now \"Request\" and \"Send\" buttons to make it easier to manage cash directly from Wallet.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/apple-cash-buttons.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1465\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-842148\" />\n<br/>\n<h2>Universal Control</h2>\n<br/>\nAccording to Apple's macOS release notes, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/universal-control/\">Universal Control</a> in the new iPadOS 15.5 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> 12.4 updates is not compatible with machines running macOS 12.3 or iPadOS 15.4, so Apple suggests that as a workaround, users should update their ‌Universal Control‌ devices to the new betas.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/macos-monterey-universal-control.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1321\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-803870\" />\n<br/>\n<h2>SportsKit Updates</h2>\n<br/>\nApple is continuing to build out its \"SportsKit\" support as it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/29/apple-tv-plus-friday-night-baseball-april-8/\">prepares to launch</a> Friday Night Baseball, and there are TV app mentions for reporting scores for different baseball innings.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<h2>iTunes Pass Rebranding</h2>\n<br/>\nApple is apparently working to rebrand the \"iTunes Pass\" in Wallet, renaming it \"Apple Balance.\" References to Apple Balance were highlighted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/04/05/apple-to-rebrand-itunes-pass-in-wallet-app-with-ios-15-5/\">9to5Mac</a></em> and have been confirmed by <em>MacRumors</em>.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThere used to be an option to add an \"iTunes Pass\" to the Wallet app that features the money associated with your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a>. Apple appears to have removed the option to add an iTunes Pass in the United States, but it is still present in other countries. It's possible a whole new Apple Balance option will be coming to the Wallet app in the future.\n<br/>\n \n<br/>\n\"Your account balance can be used to buy products, accessories, apps, games and more online or in store with ‌Apple Pay‌,\" reads the code.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<h2>Other Features</h2>\n<br/>\nFind another iOS 15.5 feature that we left out?

				"title": "Developers May Soon Be Able to Automatically Charge Apple Users for Subscription Price Increases",
				"description": "Apple appears to be testing a new feature that would allow developers to automatically charge users when a subscription price goes up, according to <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/apple-pilot-tests-feature-that-allows-developers-to-automatically-charge-users-for-subscription-price-increases/\">TechCrunch</a></em>.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Clorange.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-833988\" />\n<br/>\nRight now, Apple asks customers to explicitly agree to subscription pricing increases when the cost of a subscription goes up. If a customer does not tap on the presented \"Agree to New Price\" button, their subscription is automatically canceled. But if the new functionality that Apple is testing rolls out, customers may simply be notified of an upcoming change, rather than being given the choice to cancel. Essentially, Apple is testing an opt-out system rather than an opt-in system for subscription pricing changes.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nWhen Disney+ recently increased its prices to $7.99 per month, some developers noticed that the Disney+ app sent out a notification that was more of an alert about a price increase rather than a clear opt-in choice. Disney+ subscribers received a notification with a large \"OK\" button letting them know about the change, but there was no built-in opt-out button, with the app instead providing a link to change the subscription.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nOther developers noticed similar behavior for different subscriptions, and an Apple spokesperson confirmed to <em>TechCrunch</em> that it is running a pilot test on a new subscription system.<blockquote>\"We are piloting a new commerce feature we plan to launch very soon. The pilot includes developers across various app categories, organization sizes, and regions to help test an upcoming enhancement that we believe will be great for both developers and users, and we'll have more details to share in the coming weeks,\" the spokesperson said.</blockquote>If this change rolls out more widely, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> users will need to keep a closer eye on their subscriptions, as it will be easier for a pricing increase to go under the radar without the express opt-in system that's currently in place.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nApple would not provide more details on the pilot test, and did not offer information on the apps that are currently involved or when the feature might roll out more widely to all developers.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/\">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/05/app-store-subscription-pricing-increase-changes/\">Developers May Soon Be Able to Automatically Charge Apple Users for Subscription Price Increases</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/developers-may-soon-be-able-to-automatically-charge-apple-users-for-subscription-price-increases.2340744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yqNI2Si13No:vHeJk4rgmBg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yqNI2Si13No:vHeJk4rgmBg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

				"description": "Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/make-google-maps-your-copilot-these-new-updates/\">today updated</a> its dedicated Google Maps app for iOS devices, introducing several new features that will improve the navigation experience on iPhones.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Google-maps-feaure-green.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-793591\" />\n<br/>\nThere is a more detailed navigation map that Google says is designed to make it easier for people to drive on unfamiliar roads. Google Maps will show traffic lights and stop signs along the route, and enhanced details like building outlines and areas of interest.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nIn select cities, Google will provide even more information, such as the shape and width of a road, including medians and islands. The feature is rolling out to iOS and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> users in select countries \"in the coming weeks.\"\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nOn drives that involve toll roads as part of the directions, Google Maps will now provide an estimated toll price before you begin navigating. Google will look at factors like the cost of using a toll pass or other payment methods, along with what day of the week it is, to provide an estimate.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nGoogle will show both toll routes and toll-free routes, and users can still use the \"avoid tolls\" toggle to always see toll-free routes. Toll prices will be available for 2000 toll roads in the U.S., India, Japan, and Indonesia this month, with support in other countries coming soon.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nGoogle is adding a new Apple Watch experience that will let users get directions on Google Maps directly from the watch. In a few weeks, Google Maps users will be able to tap on the Google Maps shortcut in the Apple Watch app and then start navigation without the need for a connected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. There's also a \"Take me home\" complication that's coming to make it easy to get quick directions back to a set location.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThere are also several other updates that will improve Maps on iOS. Google is adding a new pinned trip widget that will let users see trips that have been pinned in the Go Tab right on the iOS Home screen. The widget will display arrival time, the next departure time for a transit trip, and a suggested route when driving.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe existing Google Maps search widget will be updated to be smaller, and soon, Google plans to add Google Maps integration directly into Spotlight, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and the Shortcuts app. Once set up, users can say \"Hey ‌Siri‌, get directions\" or \"Hey ‌Siri‌, search in Google Maps\" to use the new functionality.

Since their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/beats-studio-buds-launch/\">launch in June 2021</a>, the Beats Studio Buds have only been available in red, white, and black.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe Beats Studio Buds are very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, featuring in-ear silicone tips, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Transparency mode, quick pairing, Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> support, and Spatial Audio, for a price of $149.99.

				"title": "Kuo: Second-Generation AirPods Pro to Launch in Second Half of 2022",
				"description": "Apple plans to release second-generation AirPods Pro in the second half of 2022, well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1511358915426263046\">in a tweet</a> today. \n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/airpods-pro-black-background.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-816619\" />\n<br/>\nWhile the second-generation AirPods have remained available to purchase since Apple released third-generation AirPods last year, Kuo said Apple may discontinue the original AirPods Pro when the new ones are released later this year. Apple announced the AirPods Pro on October 30, 2019, making them nearly two and half years old.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nKuo also said that demand for the third-generation AirPods is \"significantly weaker\" than for the second-generation AirPods, resulting in Apple reducing its third-generation AirPods orders from suppliers by at least 30% in the second to third quarter of this year.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">AirPods 3 orders for 2-3Q22 have been cut by 30%+. Due to the failed product segmentation strategy, demand for AirPods 3 is significantly weaker than for AirPods 2. AirPods Pro may get discontinued after Apple launches AirPods Pro 2 in 2H22 to avoid repeating the same mistake.</p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1511358915426263046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<br/>\nKuo has previously claimed that the second-generation AirPods Pro will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/kuo-airpods-pro-late-2022-launch/\">\"significantly upgraded\" wireless chip</a> compared to the H1 chip in the original AirPods Pro. The chip powers audio-related functions like active noise cancellation, and improvements to this technology could result in improved battery life for longer listening time per charge. Kuo also expects the new AirPods Pro to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/02/airpods-pro-2-lossless-and-sound-emitting-case/\">support lossless audio on Apple Music</a>.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nKuo also previously claimed that the new AirPods Pro charging case will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/02/airpods-pro-2-lossless-and-sound-emitting-case/\">able to emit a sound</a> to help users find it when misplaced. It is likely the charging case will also have water resistance like the third-generation AirPods charging case.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Debby Wu have previously reported that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">tested a more compact design</a> for the new AirPods Pro that would eliminate the stems that drop below the earbuds. If this ends up being the final design, the new AirPods Pro could look similar to Apple's Beats Studio Buds released last year.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nGurman and Wu also claimed the new AirPods Pro would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/airpods-pro-2-with-sensors-and-fitness-coming-2022/\">feature motion sensors</a> for fitness tracking capabilities alongside the Apple Watch.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-2/\">AirPods Pro 2</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/05/kuo-airpods-pro-2-in-second-half-2022/\">Kuo: Second-Generation AirPods Pro to Launch in Second Half of 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-second-generation-airpods-pro-to-launch-in-second-half-of-2022.2340726/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5cExxZEzagE:2QBxj6qNU0g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5cExxZEzagE:2QBxj6qNU0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

With Discover, customers can add any TV show or movie into their <a href=\"https://watch.plex.tv/\">Plex Watchlist</a>, and receive information on where to find it.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/plex-discover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-841961\" />\n<br/>\nThe feature will inform users which streaming service has the content that they want to watch, and if the user has a subscription to that service, the content can be watched directly from Plex. It's similar to how the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app works, but it is more universal because it does not require an Apple device, and it also works with all streaming services, Netflix included.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nTo go along with Discover, Plex is debuting the Plex Universal Watchlist, which is an all-in-one watchlist that lets customers keep track of anything that they want to watch. The Universal Watchlist will display newly available titles from shows that are still airing, and it will let users know where the content they want to watch is available.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/plex-watchlist.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-841962\" />\n<br/>\nPlex says that its new feature set is meant to turn Plex into a one-stop shop for all media content. In addition to supporting watchlists and content from streaming services, Plex offers a selection of free, ad-supported TV shows and movies, plus it supports personal media libraries and live content.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nMore information about Discover and Universal Watchlist can be <a href=\"https://www.plex.tv/\">found on the Plex website</a>.

They then sat outside the same store, still connected to its Wi-Fi network, and used the logged-in employee account on the Isaac to acquire thousands of dollars worth of digital gift cards.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe digital gift card redemption codes were then loaded into the Wallet app to generate QR codes, which were screenshotted and sent via iMessage to the other conspirator, who was then able to walk into other Apple Stores and buy a range of high-value Apple devices. This process was then repeated across the country, allowing the pair to defraud Apple out of more than $1.5 million in total, according to the indictment.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nOne of the scammers stole $50,000 worth of digital Apple gift cards in Texas, while on the same day, his partner used the gift cards to buy thousands of dollars worth of Apple products in New York. The haul in Southlake, Texas, alone totaled $50,000 using 26 digital gift cards.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe pair were finally caught stealing Isaac devices in Apple Stores on CCTV and were eventually tracked down using their cellphone via GPS, before finally being arrested by the FBI. They subsequently pled guilty to wire fraud.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndtx/pr/two-men-sentenced-combined-13-years-15-million-apple-gift-card-scheme\">press release</a> from the United States Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Texas, the perpetrators have now been sentenced to a combined 13 years in federal prison and ordered to pay $1.26 million in restitution to Apple. It is unclear if Apple has made any changes to its internal systems and access to employee accounts on Isaacs to prevent the same scam from being attempted again.<br/>This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/05/apple-scammers-sentenced-13-years-in-jail/\">Scammers Who Stole $1.5 Million From Apple Sentenced to Combined 13 Years in Jail</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/scammers-who-stole-1-5-million-from-apple-sentenced-to-combined-13-years-in-jail.2340708/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ckK2ANyykUs:VAhwRU3YphE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ckK2ANyykUs:VAhwRU3YphE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

				"description": "The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> Max will feature 20 percent smaller bezels around the display, according to newly shared CAD renders.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/iphone-14-pro-max-bezels-render.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-841986\" />\n<br/>\nThe CAD renders, shared by the Twitter account \"ShrimpApplePro,\" show a design for the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max that is broadly in line with other illustrations and measurements from <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/16/iphone-14-pro-cad-renders-no-notch/\">91Mobiles</a></em> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/22/iphone-14-pro-detailed-schematics/\">Max Weinbach</a>. Much like these previous renders, the most noticeable changes include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/27/alleged-iphone-14-pro-display-schematic/\">centered</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/iphone-14-pro-pill-shaped-plus-hole/\">pill and hole-punch shaped front-facing True Depth camera array</a> in place of the notch and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/27/iphone-14-pro-larger-camera-bump-48mp-system/\">larger rear camera bump</a>, but otherwise the design seems to be very similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a>. The renders are accompanied by a range of specific measurements for different aspects of the device.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max's bezels will reportedly be 1.95mm thick, a moderate reduction compared to the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max's 2.42mm bezels. One reason for the reduced bezels could be to make more space between the top bezel of the device and the top of the new pill and hole-punch cutouts. With these reduced bezels, the top of the cutouts will purportedly sit 2.29mm below the top bezel of the display.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deleted the last one because of wrong calculation. 😬 <br>That’s why you should double check everything. <a href=\"https://t.co/OG7uO1FBxK\">pic.twitter.com/OG7uO1FBxK</a></p>— ShrimpApplePro 🍤 (@VNchocoTaco) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1511052403197751296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe extent to which the reduced bezels will have a noticeable effect on the front of the device is questionable. Last year, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/any-reason-the-13-series-bezels-are-thicker-than-the-ones-on-the-12-series-besides-to-try-and-make-the-now-taller-notch-not-stand-out-as-much.2313387/post-30359203\">users debated</a> whether there was a difference between the sizes of the ‌iPhone 12‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>'s bezels, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1441450358673272834?s=20&t=pg5FKFCEnWNYsPGID8DmMA\">measurements taken by Quinn Nelson</a> suggest that the bezels around the ‌iPhone 13‌ are indeed slightly larger than the bezels around the ‌iPhone 12‌, so it would not be unheard of for Apple to slightly change the thickness of its bezels even on devices that ostensibly have the same display sizes.\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nNevertheless, a 20 percent reduction on the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max is likely to be more noticeable than any change between the ‌iPhone 12‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ models, but it is worth noting that these measurements do not include the 1.15mm thickness of the stainless steel frame that sits around the display, which could make the change look less drastic. The reduced bezels are likely also too small to change Apple's marketed 6.7-inch screen size, even if the actual display area is larger in reality.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/\">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><br/>This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/05/iphone-14-pro-max-to-feature-thinner-bezels/\">iPhone 14 Pro Max Rumored to Feature 20% Thinner Display Bezels</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-max-rumored-to-feature-20-thinner-display-bezels.2340698/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DWei-fugnuE:k6IEtbWz-bY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DWei-fugnuE:k6IEtbWz-bY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",
