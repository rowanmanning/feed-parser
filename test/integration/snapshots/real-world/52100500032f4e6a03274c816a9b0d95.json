But when it comes to travel photography, the truth is: while we all do it — few do it well.  So if you’re looking to take your travel photography to the next level, you’re in the right place. </p><p>We recently caught up with a few of our favourite travel photographers on Unsplash to chat about everything from their travel photography gear when travelling, to their top tips for the beginners out there.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2369\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"How to elevate your travel photography\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2514\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"How to elevate your travel photography\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@genebrut\">Gene Brutty</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"but-first-why-travel-photography\">But first, why travel photography?</h3><p>For Unsplash contributor <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@genebrut\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong>Gene Brutty</strong></a>, travel photography is less about the excitement of being in a new place, and more about capturing “another person’s ‘normal’.” Gene says, “Typical and common tourist attractions often misrepresent the essence of a city or town. True travel photography ventures beyond tourist hotspots and explores the side streets, and unsassuming locations to really capture the heart of the place.” </p><p><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@danieljschwarz\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong>Daniel Schwarz </strong></a>appreciates the added goal or end mission when he’s travelling.

For this reason, <strong>Gene</strong> keeps it simple and opts for his Sony a7R  III and two lenses (Sony 24-70mm GM, and Sony 85mm).</p><p>Unsplash contributor <strong>Ryunosuke’s</strong> camera of choice? The Nikon Z6 II. He’ll also typically travel with three lenses: NIKKOR Z \"24-70mm F4 /S\", \"24mm F1.8 /S\", \"40mm F2. He says, “I especially love the 24mm f/1.8 / S that I bought for shooting landscapes because it provides a really great rendering.” And last, he’ll bring a tripod because “it’s essential for nighttime photography.”</p><p><strong>Daniel</strong> says  the most important thing for him is “to have reliable gear that can withstand sandstorms or rain.” He uses his Canon 6D Mark II with a Tamron 24-70mm F/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens and an iPhone 11.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-3LRDLqlmvrY-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"How to elevate your travel photography\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-3LRDLqlmvrY-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-3LRDLqlmvrY-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-3LRDLqlmvrY-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-3LRDLqlmvrY-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-YtY724tdl7Y-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"How to elevate your travel photography\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-YtY724tdl7Y-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-YtY724tdl7Y-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-YtY724tdl7Y-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/daniel-j-schwarz-YtY724tdl7Y-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@danieljschwarz\">Daniel J. Schwarz</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"the-challenges-of-travel-photography\">The challenges of travel photography</h3><p>For most, the challenge (and beauty) of travel photography revolves around shooting unfamiliar places. This is why <strong>Mehmet</strong> believes the most important part to travel photography is studying the destination beforehand and bringing the right equipment. He says, “Do a preliminary study of the region to be travelled and examine the photos taken before about that region. Pre-design the compositions and set up the equipment.”</p><p>While it often pays to prepare and plan, <strong>Ryunosuke</strong> admits, “It won’t always be possible to take the photos you envision.” But often, these challenges can become ways to capture new places in unique ways. On a past trip to Vancouver,</p><p><strong>Ryunosuke</strong> recounts: “It rained the entire time I was there. However, I used the puddles that appeared to take some nice reflection photography. Even unexpected moments like that can make travel photography even more enjoyable depending on your way of thinking.”</p><h3 id=\"top-tips-for-beginners-looking-to-improve-their-travel-photos\">Top tips for beginners looking to improve their travel photos</h3><p><strong>Daniel’s</strong> top tip? Know your camera. He warns, “Don’t let the camera occupy the moments. Know your equipment so you don’t waste time on technical stuff.“ Then, it all comes down to patience. Remember that “you are not in a studio, you have to wait until the clouds or sun are at a place you want them to be.”</p><p>With <strong>Gene</strong>, it’s simple: <em>Walk. “</em>Walk everywhere if possible. Walk aimlessly, walk slowly, take the long way on purpose - the unexpected moments you will uncover by doing this will be better than any photo you plan for.”</p><p>For <strong>Ryunosuke</strong>, it’s all about experimenting with different perspectives. “Try boldly moving  closer or further away. Play around with extreme low or high angles or from directly below or above your subject without relying solely on the camera's lens zoom. Then, it will be able to take own special or unique travel photography that are different from those than always.”</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3006\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"How to elevate your travel photography\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3006\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"How to elevate your travel photography\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@ryunosuke_kikuno\">Ryunosuke Kikuno</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"fondest-photographs-from-past-travels\">Fondest photographs from past travels</h3><p>A photograph from <strong>Gene’s</strong> travels in Mumbai continues to stick with him, even now. He recounts, “I was in a car on my way to a work meeting when I saw two small children living on the corner of an enormous intersection. It was a really confronting scene that I couldn’t ignore.” While his original intention was to capture the entire intersection, his car crossed the busy street too quickly: “Instead, I chose to capture this really sweet and intimate moment between two children, and focus on the fact they had each other.”</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_AA56DA5B698791ADA567EF417E99798D2C256E9E07D21E2FC70DBFA6457B4BFD_1648459634828_image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"How to elevate your travel photography\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><strong>Daniel’s</strong> most memorable photograph was taken after a long hike getting caught in the rain back from Preikestolen, Norway.  After a few hours of waiting in their vans, a beautiful rainbow showed up above their camp spot.

He says, “Don’t take travel photos out of a sense of obligation because it’s a trip. No amount of technique or gear can replace your passion for the subject matter.”</p><p>Most importantly? <strong>Daniel</strong> says, “Never forget that you travel to soak up new things, to learn and grow, and to live your life — it’s not all about taking that 100% polished shot. You will associate some great moments with every photo you take!”</p>",

And while the water crisis is huge, we’re optimistic. We know how to solve the problem, and we make progress every day thanks to the help of local partners and generous supporters.

There is water in countries where they work that is milky gray, mustard yellow, and forest green.

In the Before Times I'd often spend at least an afternoon or two a week working from a cafe or coworking space, something just to change up the scenery a bit.

Nonetheless - and maybe this is just me being a masochist - but I get a lot of satisfaction out of really getting into the weeds figuring out weird obscure bugs, and then writing up a whole danged treatise on my journey in the description of the fix.</p><p>This assumes that I do in fact succeed in getting to a fix, which is maybe a dubious assumption.</p><h3 id=\"what-do-you-do-when-you-aren%E2%80%99t-working-on-unsplash\">What do you do when you aren’t working on Unsplash? </h3><p>I build scale models. Not so much kits out-of-box much anymore - instead it's mostly scratchbuilding or kitbashing scifi space ships and robots and stuff. Been slowly getting more into more scenic diorama projects; I'm just wrapping up a fairy house diorama as a gift for my mom, but that's still a surprise which means now that I've written this down I have to make sure she doesn't read this.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/IMG_1751.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Meet the Unsplash Team : Aaron Klaassen\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2667\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/IMG_1751.jpeg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/IMG_1751.jpeg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/IMG_1751.jpeg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/IMG_1751.jpeg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"describe-yourself-using-3-emojis\">Describe yourself using 3 emojis</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Aaron-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Meet the Unsplash Team : Aaron Klaassen\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1241\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Aaron-1.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Aaron-1.png 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Aaron-1.png 1241w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"where-can-people-find-youchat-to-you\">Where can people find you/chat to you?</h3><p>Twitter, I suppose: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronklaassen\">@aaronklaassen</a></p>",

And even if they look fine at first glance, give your screens a good clean as your camera will pick up on <em>everything</em>. To clean my screen, I typically use the cloths you get to clean your glasses. If that doesn’t work, I use screen wipes designed for your digital screens to get off stubborn grime.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/image.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/image.png 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/image.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"tip-2-set-the-scene\">Tip 2: Set the scene</h3><p>Whether you’re shooting your phone screen or your desktop monitor — pay attention to what else will make it into the frame. Is your desk littered with crumpled papers? Are any post-its with your passwords on show? Make sure the surroundings feel natural and intentional.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/mikhail-fesenko-7wLQNYKL3Rw-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/mikhail-fesenko-7wLQNYKL3Rw-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/mikhail-fesenko-7wLQNYKL3Rw-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/mikhail-fesenko-7wLQNYKL3Rw-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/mikhail-fesenko-7wLQNYKL3Rw-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/vadim-bozhko-SM_hz_zkXxM-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/vadim-bozhko-SM_hz_zkXxM-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/vadim-bozhko-SM_hz_zkXxM-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/vadim-bozhko-SM_hz_zkXxM-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/vadim-bozhko-SM_hz_zkXxM-unsplash.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/behnam-norouzi-n3WtsUUo14E-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3172\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/behnam-norouzi-n3WtsUUo14E-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/behnam-norouzi-n3WtsUUo14E-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/behnam-norouzi-n3WtsUUo14E-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/behnam-norouzi-n3WtsUUo14E-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption>Featuring: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@proggga\">Mikhail Fesenko</a>, <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bozhstudio\">Vadim Bozhko</a> and <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@behy_studio\">Behnam Norouzi</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"tip-3-use-soft-natural-light\">Tip 3: Use soft natural light</h3><p>That pesky glare we mentioned? That can be avoided by shooting LCD screens in soft natural light. Artificial lighting will inevitably give off more glare — but if natural lighting isn’t available, be sure you experiment with the angle of your phone and camera. And make sure your phone never has direct light hitting it to avoid unwanted glare. The secret to getting great photos of your screens is truly all about getting the right angle.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"879\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption>Play with the angle of the camera or phone so that the screen is showing minimal shadows and glare for the shot.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"tip-4-try-a-small-aperture\">Tip 4: Try a small aperture </h3><p>Use a small aperture so the whole screen is in focus. If you're holding your phone in your hand, you’ll be able to retain a good depth of field while keeping the phone as the main subject. If you’re shooting your desktop, I typically make sure the screen isn’t too close to my camera, and experiment with the angles so you can minimize reflections and have a nice depth of field in the background.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/RaPmJKjU.png\" width=\"687\" height=\"1030\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/RaPmJKjU.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/RaPmJKjU.png 687w\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ZinZZqxw.png\" width=\"687\" height=\"1031\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/ZinZZqxw.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ZinZZqxw.png 687w\"></div></div></div><figcaption>Featuring: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@techdailyca\">Tech Daily</a> and <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@ingoodhands\">Good Faces Agency</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"tip-5-turn-down-screen-brightness\">Tip 5: Turn down screen brightness </h3><p>To avoid overexposing your shots, turn down your screen brightness accordingly. This will ensure that your photos remain balanced. Another option? Shoot a few photos in dark mode. </p><h3 id=\"tip-6-minimize-reflections\">Tip 6: Minimize reflections </h3><p>While some reflections are okay, others can feel like they detract from the final image. To reduce jarring reflections, you can hold a dark reflector between your light source and your screen. You don’t need a fancy kit to achieve great results, I use a little piece of black card as my reflector which has served me well!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--3-.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1292\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--3-.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--3-.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--3-.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--3-.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--4-.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"914\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Back to Basics: How to shoot screens\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--4-.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--4-.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--4-.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Image-from-iOS--4-.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div></figure><p>While taking photos of digital screens can take a little experimentation, it’s a great way to test your photography skills and try out new photoshoot ideas.

It’s a nickname the team gave me after I’ve posted a photo of a bear on Unsplash many years ago.</p><p>I work as a software developer on the web team, the user-facing part of Unsplash.com. If you ever clicked on a button and nothing happened, it’s probably a bug I introduced.</p><h3 id=\"when-did-you-join-the-team\">When did you join the team?</h3><p>My story with Unsplash starts in around 2014 when I first got hired as a backend developer for our parent company back in the days, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mikaelcho/we-just-sold-crew-to-dribbble-b69a360da30b\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">Crew</a>. Remember that photo of a bear I posted?

I was born Belgian and soon to be Canadian (gentle reminder to the Canadian government to finish processing my application, thank you).</p><h3 id=\"who-do-you-primarily-work-with-on-the-team\">Who do you primarily work with on the team?</h3><p>I’ll say mainly my teammates in the web team (Olly, Sam and Nim) and outside of web I think Kirill. We’re a pretty small team so I think we all talk to each other regularly.</p><h3 id=\"why-do-you-enjoy-working-on-unsplash\">Why do you enjoy working on Unsplash?</h3><p>I obviously like the product and the impact it has on the community. Photography has always been a little side passion of me but most importantly I really enjoy the culture we’ve created. Everyone has the flexibility of working however they like, whenever they like. No set hours, no time tracking, unlimited vacations (it actually is true). We were remote-friendly before it was cool. We believe people know best how and when to do their best work. This is the kind of culture I was looking for and to this day I use it to the fullest (skiing in the middle of the week, anyone?)</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-favorite-thing-you-worked-on-at-unsplash\">What is your favorite thing you worked on at Unsplash?</h3><p>Hard to say, there are so many, but I will say that what I’m currently working on right now is really exciting. I can’t really say anything but I think it’ll make Unsplash more inclusive and I’m excited for more people to be able to use it!</p><h3 id=\"what-do-you-like-to-listen-to-while-you-work\">What do you like to listen to while you work?</h3><p>Ouf, that’s a tough one. Honestly, it can range from LoFi to House, funk to Taylor Swift, and sometimes podcasts. It really depends on my mood and what I’m currently doing. Right now I’m listening to Jazz :). One song that I listened to a lot while building Unsplash is “The Other Side Of Paradise” from Glass animals.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" title=\"Spotify Embed: The Other Side Of Paradise\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0rRjGruFonCGOt0S5zAJNQ?si=e7a8cb250b404f63&utm_source=oembed\"></iframe></figure><h3 id=\"what-do-you-do-when-you-aren%E2%80%99t-working-on-unsplash\">What do you do when you aren’t working on Unsplash? </h3><p>Good question.

I also used to play much more video games but I still enjoy it quite a bit. Taking care of my plants, doing some homemade interior design plans. I’ve also started making candles! Cooking all the good stuff, I recently made tonkotsu ramen.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/FBG0MjGW.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Meet the Unsplash team: Thomas Lefebvre\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/FBG0MjGW.jpeg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/FBG0MjGW.jpeg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/FBG0MjGW.jpeg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/FBG0MjGW.jpeg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"describe-yourself-using-3-emojis\">Describe yourself using 3 emojis</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Thomas.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Meet the Unsplash team: Thomas Lefebvre\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1241\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Thomas.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Thomas.png 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Thomas.png 1241w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"where-can-people-find-youchat-with-you\">Where can people find you/chat with you?</h3><p>You can find me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomlbvr\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imthebear_\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">IG</a> and here’s also my <a href=\"https://github.com/Magellol\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">Github</a>!

He was pushing for me to upload my work on Unsplash, as he thought it would be ‘the new up and coming’ platform for photographers, and I would not only fit well with their vision and style, but would benefit from it — and boy was he right. </p><p>At a first glance, it all looked very intimidating and I did not feel confident enough to upload any pictures.  I did however upload 10 of my best pictures from our recent ski trip to get my husband off my back — the next day I received a notification on Instagram that Unsplash tagged me in a post. I remember the excitement like it was yesterday, I felt so seen and validated, to have them share one of my pictures when I didn’t think that my work would be of any use. There were tears of course.</p><p>It was the first platform that interacted with you as a user, it had that human factor, it made you feel celebrated rather than being used - this is number one reason why I continued uploading and being part of this community.\"</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Behind 1 Billion: Toa Heftiba\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2797\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Toa's first upload.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"how-do-you-feel-your-photography-has-grown-since-you-started-out-on-unsplash\">How do you feel your photography has grown since you started out on Unsplash?</h3><p>\"I think I grew in confidence the most, which reflects in my work. Being able to take part in bigger projects, like shooting for ‘Samsung’, and ‘Boxed Water is Better’ pushed me out of my comfort zone and stretched my limits. Photoclubs have also been a source of growth, and a place to form friendships.\"</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/toa-heftiba-v1NeSutzVIA-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Behind 1 Billion: Toa Heftiba\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-v1NeSutzVIA-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/toa-heftiba-v1NeSutzVIA-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-v1NeSutzVIA-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/toa-heftiba-v1NeSutzVIA-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/toa-heftiba-OcIdf1fKSk0-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Behind 1 Billion: Toa Heftiba\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-OcIdf1fKSk0-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/toa-heftiba-OcIdf1fKSk0-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-OcIdf1fKSk0-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/toa-heftiba-OcIdf1fKSk0-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/toa-heftiba-iB5LQtBCYw8-unsplash.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Behind 1 Billion: Toa Heftiba\" srcset=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-iB5LQtBCYw8-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/toa-heftiba-iB5LQtBCYw8-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-iB5LQtBCYw8-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/toa-heftiba-iB5LQtBCYw8-unsplash.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption>Intimate photos from her recent journey to motherhood.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"what-has-been-your-most-memorable-experience-on-unsplash\">What has been your most memorable experience on Unsplash?</h3><p>\"From a professional point of view, having the opportunity to create content for Samsung was my favourite experience.
