You buy a fancy new PC, and everything runs smoothly at first. And then, slowly but surely, it starts to feel more sluggish. Every week or month, things take just a little longer to load, until your PC feels like it‚Äôs running Windows 1.0, not Windows 11. If this describes you, it‚Äôs probably about time you take a look at which apps are running at startup, and strip things down to the bare essentials. We‚Äôre here to help.

Even though Earendel is 50 times the mass of the Sun, and millions of times brighter, we would not normally be able to see it.
