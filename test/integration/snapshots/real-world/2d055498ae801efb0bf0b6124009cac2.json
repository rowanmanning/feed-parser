To go out with them was to have your eyes opened to just how much of disability is socially constructed. Which is the fancy way of saying that there wouldn’t be half so many problems for loads of disabled people if shops would just bother putting ramps and lifts in, and if non-disabled people would stop staring in either disgust or fascination at anyone who deviates even slightly from the physical norm. And a special shout-out, even 20-odd years on, to the lady who advised us from a position of unassailable entitlement and fury to “Stop breeding”.</p><p>On the other hand, we – as a group, and my boyfriend and his son as individuals – were, for the bulk of the time, met with great kindness, generosity and practical help from the non-staring demographic. But it is inescapably the case that to live with any condition that marks you out from the herd is to live, to some degree, in a different world from most.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/05/ellie-simmonds-a-world-without-dwarfism-review-are-drugs-really-the-answer\">Continue reading...</a>",

JK Rowling co-writes the screenplay with Steve Kloves; Potter veteran David Yates directs with a sure hand; and Eddie Redmayne is looking more eccentric and Dickensian than ever in his role, a Copperfield or even a young Mr Dick with his shock of hair, faintly unfocused gaze, unworldly bowtie and fractionally too-short trousers.</p><p>The Secrets of Dumbledore is another very amiable and lovely-looking fantasy adventure with some great production design and visual effects, especially in the New York scenes. But it’s not about “secrets” as much as new IP-franchise narrative components shuffled into the ongoing content and shuffled out again. Yet there is certainly something intriguing about the questions arising from the saga’s approach to the existing Potter timeline.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/05/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review-good-natured-magical-entertainment\">Continue reading...</a>",

You know the one: three bold letters arranged in an arch across the chest. It was everywhere in the 1990s and 00s, sold in a rainbow of saturated colours. This sweatshirt didn’t signal a taste for fashion so much as a desire for comfort at a reasonable price. It was like the air we breathed, or the muzak floating around as we prowled the mall, ever-present and hardly worth remarking upon.</p><p>Over the years, the sweatshirt faded out of view, until, in 2020, an odd thing happened: it suddenly became a hot fashion item at the hands of gen Z. On Instagram and TikTok, stylish young influencers started posting photos and videos of themselves wearing Gap hoodies. Suddenly these hoodies looked rather hip and cool. The YouTube star Emma Chamberlain posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXoGzkJ0Np/\" title=\"\">series of photos</a> of herself on Instagram, her expression oscillating between detached, sleepy, and slightly mournful, as she stood next to a pool wearing white bikini bottoms and a navy Gap logo hoodie.

It is an act of political dogma and score-settling</p><p>In 1982, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/channel-4-the-40-year-countdown-to-privatisation\">established Channel 4</a> in order to create an independent television production sector in the UK. Unlike the BBC or ITV, it was not to make any of its own programmes, not even its flagship Channel 4 News. All over the UK, independent companies sprang up to make its content. In the 40 years since, they have made billions of pounds – not just for themselves but also for Britain, selling their wares around the world. And, unlike the BBC, they have spoken with many voices, bringing diverse and radical ideas to the fore which had barely been heard before in mainstream broadcasting.</p><p>Yesterday, Boris Johnson’s Conservative government announced it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/apr/05/channel-4-boris-johnson-conservatives-nadine-dorries-latest-updates-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-624bfb008f08fd70369de400#:~:text=From%204h%20ago-,09%3A28,-Privatising%20Channel%204\">selling off the channel</a>, claiming that by doing so it would boost independent production companies. This makes no sense. Instead of Channel 4 being a publicly-owned organisation that pumps hundreds of millions of pounds a year into the independent sector, it is being sold off, almost certainly to a giant TV production company, possibly from overseas. It will be in the interests of that company to make as many of its own programmes as it can and retain the rights in them.</p><p>Dorothy Byrne is the former head of news and current affairs at Channel 4 and president of Murray Edwards College, Cambridge</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/sell-off-channel-4-wont-benefit-anyone-but-boris-johnson\">Continue reading...</a>",

It is impossible to take her seriously as a politician of substance, but she seems determined to do – and capable of doing – serious damage. She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/nadine-dorries-to-press-ahead-with-plan-to-privatise-channel-4\" title=\"\">restated</a> her intention to push ahead with selling off Channel 4, in order, she says, to allow it to compete with Netflix and Amazon, from which destiny it is currently being “held back”. This makes no sense, and shows a lack of understanding of what these streamers are and what they do (giant US tech companies aiming for global reach); and of what Channel 4 is and does (a British public-service broadcaster that publishes, rather than owns, the material it commissions, and is aimed at generating a diverse, lively domestic production sector).</p><p>Why anyone would feel the need to transform Channel 4’s ownership arrangements is a mystery. A Tory government rejected the notion in 2016. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/05/senior-tories-speak-out-against-channel-4-privatisation-plans\" title=\"\">senior Conservatives</a>, including the former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and Ruth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Tories, have publicly condemned the idea since the culture secretary’s latest pronouncement on the matter. What many Tories grasp, but Ms Dorries seems not to, is that Channel 4, though in public ownership, costs the taxpayer nothing, since it raises its own cash and then, crucially, ploughs its revenues back into commissioning. In November she <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2021/11/nadine-dorries-who-owns-channel-4-doesnt-know-who-pays-for-channel-4\" title=\"\">asserted</a> to a parliamentary select committee that the channel is funded by the taxpayer. This is quite simply untrue (indeed, she was immediately corrected by her questioner, fellow Tory Damian Green).

Woods was 10 and had been out to play nine holes with his dad that morning but they were back in front of the TV in time to see Nicklaus, then 46, come round the turn in one of the most famous rounds in the history of the majors. From six shots back he made five birdies and an eagle and won by one. Woods remembers watching him hit that famous second shot on the 15th, from the hill over the water and to 12 feet from the hole, and the way he raised both fists in the air to celebrate, and wondering why he was so happy when he still had to make the putt.</p><p>Over the years Woods has asked Nicklaus, more than once, what he was thinking about in that moment. Woods never really got a good answer out of Nicklaus but, according to his book Unprecedented, this is the way he has come to think about it: “He did what he needed to do to put himself in a position to win the Masters. He was not thinking about winning. He was thinking only about the shot and what he needed to do. He wasn’t getting ahead of himself.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/05/tiger-woods-prepared-to-play-through-pain-barrier-in-unlikely-masters-quest\">Continue reading...</a>",

				"description": "<p>After Putin invaded Ukraine, the Russian dancer denounced the war, left the Kremlin-allied company – and flew out of Moscow that night. As she prepares for her debut at the Dutch National Ballet, Smirnova speaks for the first time </p><p>“My life totally changed in one day,” says Olga Smirnova. “In the morning, I did not know I was going to leave Russia. And in the night, I was sitting on the plane.” The 30-year-old dancer was one of the Bolshoi Ballet’s star ballerinas, a universally lauded performer at the peak of her powers, at a company that has long had close ties to the Kremlin. Earlier this month, she made a shock announcement: she had joined Dutch National Ballet (DNB), leaving Moscow behind. The move came shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/16/a-line-has-been-drawn-olga-smirnova-quits-bolshoi-ballet-over-ukraine-war\">Smirnova wrote a heartfelt post</a> on the online messaging service Telegram about Russia’s attack on Ukraine. “With all the fibres of my soul I am against the war,” she wrote. “I never thought that I would be ashamed of Russia … But now the line is drawn on the before and after.”</p><p>Speaking via video call from Amsterdam, she explains her reason for leaving: “It did not feel safe.” Although there had been no direct threat from the authorities, she adds: “I just felt the atmosphere was tense in the country. International flights were being cancelled and there were rumours the borders would be closed, so we decided to leave. We didn’t want to risk it and wait longer.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/05/i-couldnt-keep-it-inside-ballet-star-olga-smirnova-on-quitting-the-bolshoi-and-fleeing-russia\">Continue reading...</a>",

But Covid gave contestants one that was far harder than any of those – meeting your teammates for the first time on the day of filming, especially in a game that depends so much on knowing your team’s strengths. The entertainment has not suffered, though – from first round dabs to 235 point winning margins, and no fewer than five games separated by five points, this season has certainly not struggled for drama. The same is true of last night’s nail-biting grand final.</p><p>The road to the final is often long and, due to the show’s convoluted quarter-final rules, often winding too. Not, though, for the Imperial College London quartet of Max Zeng, Fatima Sheriff, Michael Mays and Gilbert Jackson, who swatted aside St John’s, Cambridge, Exeter, Kings College London, Reading and Emmanuel College, Cambridge to make it to this stage. Their opponents: Sylvian Jesudoss, Margaret Ounsley, Michael Hutchinson and Kira Bishop, the University of Reading team completing the lineup of the first final not to feature an Oxbridge team in nine years. They knocked out the Scottish trio of Strathclyde, Dundee and Edinburgh, as well as beating Birmingham and St John’s, Cambridge, with their only blemish being a defeat to Imperial. This wasn’t necessarily reason to be downhearted, though: two teams have won the title despite facing previous conquerors in the final. Ahead of last night’s grand final, the only thing we could guarantee was that the trophy would go to a captain called Michael.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/05/im-going-to-get-so-roasted-for-this-the-nail-biting-university-challenge-final-reviewed-by-last-years-winner\">Continue reading...</a>",

Was it some special property of the microphones, or the way the snare drum was tuned, or even the kind of carpeting used in the company’s Detroit studio? One vital factor was overlooked, because its presence was almost subliminal: the rhythm guitar playing of Joe Messina, who has died aged 93.</p><p>A jazz-trained musician, Messina often did little more on a Motown record than play a chord on every backbeat, the second and fourth beats of each bar. But those downstrokes added a certain thickness and tone to beats already being given their weight by the snare drum and their cutting edge by a tambourine.

No wonder Christopher Eccleston and Julian Barratt were lining up to star</p><p>Of all the upsides that come with the BBC having two dedicated children’s channels, there is one small loss. Unless you have children or grandchildren, you are unlikely to accidentally discover a brilliant new kids’ show like, say, hungover students discovered Teletubbies in the 1990s. The only way that might happen now is if someone makes a children’s show so fantastic that it gets passed all the way up to the main channels.</p><p>Dodger is that show. Created by Rhys Thomas (best known for creating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/dec/10/if-theres-a-funnier-show-than-brian-pern-a-life-in-rock-ill-be-staggered\">BBC mockumentary Brian Pern</a>) and written with his wife, the actor Lucy Montgomery, Dodger is technically a prequel to Oliver. But it’s more than an origin story for the Artful Dodger. The show is loaded with acting talent – Christopher Eccleston plays Fagin, David Threlfall is the chief of police, with Julian Barratt, Alexei Sayle and Frances Barber popping up along the way. The whole thing clatters along breathlessly like an episodic version of The Goonies. Hence its promotion from CBBC to BBC One.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/05/dodger-the-oliver-twist-prequel-thats-scary-starry-and-totally-irresistible-tv\">Continue reading...</a>",

				"description": "<p>He has grown his grey hair long and I don’t find it attractive. Am I being shallow – or is it the menopause?</p><p><strong>My husband of more than 30 years decided to grow his hair long about </strong><strong>three years ago. Sex has always been important to us and I have always felt strongly sexually attracted to him. But he is 59, with thin, fine grey </strong><strong>hair and</strong><strong>, as far as I am concerned, this is not a good look</strong><strong>. I’m struggling to maintain our previous spark. Am I just completely shallow and unreasonable to allow a small visual difference get in the way of a previously active and loving intimacy? Perhaps the issue is mine – I’m 51 and menopausal. Do other people experience this when one partner undergoes a significant physical change? Any suggestions on how to manage this would be appreciated; obviously he is his own man and if he likes the way he looks, I can’t change that.</strong></p><p>We can’t rationalise our way out of well established visual preferences. And perhaps you are someone who happens to be very much visually attuned. Some people respond more to erotic sounds and conversation, while others are turned on by scents and smells. You might want to gently request a change. On the other hand, lowered desire can also be a natural aspect of menopause, and dwindling hormones – rather than long hair – might be the culprit. With your physician, consider options to boost your libido.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

				"title": "Rail route of the month: Barcelona to Cádiz, the slow train right across Spain",
				"description": "<p>Our slow travel expert takes a 12-hour odyssey from Mediterranean Catalonia – via Cervantes, bandit and sherry country – to Atlantic Andalucía</p><p>Two long-distance trains leave Barcelona Sants station just after nine each morning. There’s the French TGV to Paris, 668 miles and almost seven hours to the north. The other train, much the more interesting of the two, is the 09.05 to Cádiz, a journey of 12 hours, covering 800 miles. This is one of Spain’s finest domestic train journeys, a great cross-country transect linking the Mediterranean coast of Catalonia with the Atlantic shores of Andalucía. The train manager on the four-carriage train to Cádiz captures it rather nicely when she says: “Welcome to the fast train to nowhere and the slow train to everywhere.”</p><p>The beauty of this dawdling journey across Spain is that it honours distance and landscapes. Despite a couple of short, high-speed stretches, the train to Cádiz generally doesn’t hurry. There’s a meditative appeal in making a long journey through a litany of changing landscapes. When did you last have 12 hours to yourself? There’s time to think, just daydream and gaze out of the window. Along the way it swaps Catalonia’s restrained charm for the fiery warmth and sensual appeal of the Spanish south. Remember Byron’s The Girl of Cadiz, who was “born beneath a brighter sun”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/05/rail-route-of-the-month-barcelona-to-cadiz-the-slow-train-right-across-spain\">Continue reading...</a>",
