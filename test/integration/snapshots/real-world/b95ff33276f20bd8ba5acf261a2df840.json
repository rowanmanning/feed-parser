				"title": "Uber will soon offer taxi rides in San Francisco",
				"description": "<p>Uber customers in San Francisco might soon find a traditional taxi waiting for them when they use the app to summon a ride. According to <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/Uber-users-could-soon-be-picked-up-by-S-F-taxis-17060031.php\"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>, the ride-hailing giant has inked a deal with Yellow Cab SF and Flywheel, the company that operates an Uber-like app used by taxi drivers across companies in the city. The agreement will give 1,075 taxi drivers in the area access to Uber customers in the coming months. Uber recently struck a similar <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uber-new-york-city-yellow-cab-141509263.html\">deal in NYC</a>, allowing people in the city to hail any of its 14,000 taxi drivers through the app. </p><p>The companies were able to finalize the deal, because the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency board has just voted in favor of allowing taxis to accept flat upfront rates for rides hailed through a third-party app. Customers can expect to pay UberX rates, which are calculated based on trip time and distance on top of a base fare, for taxi rides. The year-long pilot for the deal will begin on August 5th.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Uber's rates are typically lower than metered fares, though they could be higher during surge times. Kate Toran, SFMTA's director of taxis, said during the board meeting that Uber and Lyft fares are about 80 to 85 percent of metered rates. While drivers could earn less than usual for Uber rides, their participation is completely optional. They can accept Uber rides whenever they want, and there are no consequences for rejecting them. </p><p>Flywheel and Yellow believe the deal would benefit drivers, who could accept Uber rides to fill in gaps for dead hours. \"[H]aving some revenue come in versus no revenue is a much better situation in the end, even if it is lower than the taxi rate,\" Yellow Cab CEO Chris Sweis said. Still, not all SF cab drivers are thrilled about the development. Mark Gruberg, a board member of the San Francisco Taxi Alliance, expressed concerns about regular taxi customers being ignored during Uber surge times. Another driver told <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/uber-san-francisco-taxi-service-sf-flywheel/11714044/\"><em>ABC7News</em></a> that earning less money from Uber rides would mean he'll have a harder time paying off the debts he took to pay for his medallion, which cost $250,000.</p><p>If Uber gets its way, though, there'll be no taxi left that isn't part of its network. Uber exec Andrew Macdonald recently said during an <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/407969754/files/doc_presentations/2022/Uber-Investor-Day-Transcript_February-10-2022-(2).pdf\">investor presentation</a> (PDF) that that the company aims to put every taxi on Uber by 2025. Doing so wouldn't only increase its driver supply, it could also unlock new markets where people don't have their own cars to use for the service. </p>",

				"title": "Facebook wants you to post Reels from third-party apps",
				"description": "<p>Facebook is taking another step to encourage users to create original content for its TikTok clone. The company introduced a new <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/04/05/new-way-to-share-to-reels-on-facebook/\">“sharing to Reels”</a> feature to allow users of third-party apps to post directly to Facebook Reels.</p><p>The update allows outside developers to add a “Reels button” to their app so users can post clips directly to Reels while taking advantage of Reels’ editing tools, Facebook wrote in a blog post. Initial developers to use the feature include Smule, which makes a popular karaoke app and video editing apps Vita and VivaVideo.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The move is yet another sign of the growing importance of Reels, and how Facebook has tried to borrow from the same playbook it used with Stories. Facebook has pushed Reels into nearly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pushing-reels-into-nearly-every-part-of-its-app-170028977.html\"><ins>every part</ins></a> of its service in recent months just as it once did with Stories when the company viewed Snapchat as its chief rival. Now, with Facebook losing users to TikTok, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has staked a lot on the success of Reels. He said <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html\"><ins>last fall</ins></a> that Reels would be “as important for our products as Stories” and that reorienting its service to appeal to younger users was the company’s “North Star.”</p><p>But incentivizing users to post original content, not just ripped off TikTok clips, has been somewhat of a challenge for the company. Instagram, which has had Reels the longest, said a year ago that it would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html\"><ins>stop promoting</ins></a> videos with other apps’ watermarks, but the service is still filled with recycled TikToks. Adding a “Reels” button to other content creation apps is unlikely to solve that overnight, but it could help bring in some fresh, non-TikTok-created clips.</p>",

Therefore, it will take time and we will be actively seeking input and adversarial thinking in advance of launching Edit.”</p><p>That Twitter will start experimenting with editable tweets is a major shift for the company. Executives have long acknowledged the practicality of being able to fix typos and correct errors, but have cited concerns that an edit button could chip away at Twitter's ability to act as a public record. As recently as 2020, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said it would  <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-twitter-edit-tweet-button-jack-dorsey.html\"><ins>“probably\"</ins></a> never happen, despite previously <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-12-jack-dorsey-twitter-edit-function-done-the-right-way.html\">seeming open</a> to the idea. “We wanted to preserve that vibe, that feeling, in the early days,\" he said, referring to Twitter’s origins as an SMS-based service.</p><div id=\"e9ba55818aed458bbbab0d9e0075a66f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">4/ Therefore, it will take time and we will be actively seeking input and adversarial thinking in advance of launching Edit. We will approach this feature with care and thoughtfulness and we will share updates as we go.</p>— Jay Sullivan (@jaysullivan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaysullivan/status/1511457598834323458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Prior to Twitter confirming it was in fact working on an edit button, Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1511171084560723969\">weighed in</a> on the idea, claiming that Facebook had already “solved” issues around potential misuse. “You just include an indicator that it has been edited along with a change log,” he wrote. “If you are really worried about embeds they can point to a specific revision in that history but with a link to the latest edit. Not a real issue.” </p><p>Bringing the edit button to Twitter Blue subscribers first could also be a major boost to Twitter’s recently-launched subscription service. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/is-twitter-blue-worth-3-dollars-a-month-210059983.html\"><ins>$2.99/month</ins></a> service gives subscribers additional features, like the ability to “undo” tweets and access to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-nft-profile-photos-193912407.html\"><ins>NFT profile photos</ins></a>. But that doesn’t mean edit functionality will always be limited to those who pay. Editing will be available first as a “Twitter Blue Labs” feature, but the company has said it intends to make some “labs” features available to everyone after initial testing. Whether that will be the case with tweet editing is unclear for now.</p>",

It had roughly 17 million user accounts and 19,000 sellers.</p><p>The seizure included both the servers and crypto wallets holding about $25 million in Bitcoin. The US Justice Department simultaneously charged Russia resident Dmitry Pavlov with narcotics distribution and money laundering due to his operation of Hydra servers. Hydra mainly served people in Russian-language countries hoping to buy or deal in contraband, including drugs, hacking services and stolen data. It also participated in the previously mentioned laundering as well as crypto \"mixing\" that made it harder to track digital currency usage.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Treasury Department further <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20220405\">punished</a> Hydra and Garantex, a Russian crypto exchange, by adding them and over 100 crypto addresses to a \"specially designated nationals\" list. In a <a href=\"https://www.bka.de/DE/Presse/Listenseite_Pressemitteilungen/2022/Presse2022/220405_PM_IllegalerDarknetMarktplatz.html\">statement</a>, the Bundeskriminalamt said it had been investigating Hydra with US help since August of last year.</p><p>This is far from the first time authorities have shuttered major dark web markets. They shut down previous record-setters like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-14-authorities-bust-alphabay-the-dark-webs-biggest-marketplace.html\">AlphaBay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-10-02-fbi-seizes-black-market-site-silk-road.html\">Silk Road</a> and most recently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/darkmarket-taken-offline-125559479.html\">DarkMarket</a>. We wouldn't count on the seizure preventing other dark web shops from taking Hydra's place, then. It could disrupt operations for a while, though, and might serve as a reminder that even the larger digital black markets can fold with little warning.</p>",

				"description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games/\"><ins>Epic Games</ins></a> has built a mobile app that can turn photos into 3D scans. Capturing Reality, a company Epic <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/capturing-reality-is-now-part-of-epic-games\"><ins>bought</ins></a> last year, created photogrammetric software called RealityCapture. It can quickly convert laser scans or images into 3D scans of assets. With the RealityScan app, Epic is hoping to give users access to the same tech right on their phone. </p><div id=\"5544061ad9004503bfa46b74b74967e0\"><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2BdDqtttuA?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div></div><p>The idea is that creatives will be able to scan real-world objects at any time to use in their projects. After you sign in with your Epic Games account, the app will prompt you to take at least 20 photos of an item. You can also hold down your finger on the capture button as you move around the object. </p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>After the app processes the images and turns it into a 3D object with the help of RealityCapture's servers, you can export the scan to Sketchfab (a 3D asset platform Epic <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-3d-asset-platform-sketchfab-unreal-engine-153014312.html\"><ins>also bought in 2021</ins></a>).</p><p>You'll then be able to sell the asset to other creatives or use them for your own 3D, virtual reality and augmented reality projects. Game developers might find the app particularly useful if they're in need of a particular item to place in a virtual environment. As it happens, Epic just <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-available-release-date-151023130.html\">opened up access</a> to Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>Epic is <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/lhflbQpp\"><ins>testing a beta</ins></a> of the app with a limited number of iOS users before a broader, early access rollout on iPhone this spring. An Android version of RealityScan will arrive later this year.</p>",

Opera also won't maintain data logs that might be used to track your activity. It's too soon to know if the company will live up to promises of \"high-speed servers,\" but you can combine Opera's data-saving mode with VPN Pro to avoid running into any carrier data caps.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The VPN Pro beta is available now if you're using at least Android 6.0 and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser.beta\">Opera for Android Beta</a> 68.2. The price may be appealing, too. Early adopters can subscribe for $2 per month if they commit to three months, or $3 for one month.

				"description": "<p>As an audio company, JLab is known for producing affordable but interesting products. Take one of its more recent releases, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jlab-go-air-tones-announced-price-specs-availability-060024516.html\">Go Air Tones</a>. It worked with nail care brand ORLY to create a set of earbuds available in seven Pantone colors designed to match various skin tones. Its new <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JBuds Air Pro\" href=\"https://fave.co/3NPwom7\">JBuds Air Pro</a> offer a different value proposition. Priced at $60, they feature 6mm drivers with AAC codec support built-in, IP55 certification and up to 36 hours of playtime with the included charging case. But according to JLabs, the highlight of the JBuds Air Pro is the inclusion of Bluetooth multipoint connectivity.</p><p>That feature allows you to connect the JBuds Air Pro to two devices simultaneously. In that way, you can listen to music on your computer and then answer a call that comes to your phone without jumping into the Bluetooth settings of either device.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>JLab is positioning Bluetooth Multipoint as a value-add you won’t find on more expensive earbuds like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPods Pro</a>. But the reality is more complicated than that. Multipoint connectivity has been a part of Bluetooth since its 4.0 release more than a decade ago, but you have to go out of your way to find headphones that support the feature. Part of that is that it’s challenging to pull off correctly. For instance, on Sony’s excellent <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779.html\">WH-1000XM4</a>, multipoint connectivity only works when the headphones connect to a device via AAC. Still, it’s a handy feature and one you won’t find on many earbuds, particularly ones that cost $60.</p><p>The JBuds Air Pro are available to order today from the <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JLab website\" href=\"https://fave.co/3NPwom7\">JLab website</a>.</p>",

After the rocket’s 26th launch, which is scheduled for later this month, the company will attempt to snatch the first stage out of mid-air <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-06-rocket-lab-reusable-rocket-plans.html\">with a helicopter.</a></p><p>The mission has a 14-day launch window starting on April 19th. Electron is scheduled to lift off from a launchpad in New Zealand and will carry satellites for a number of companies. </p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Around an hour before launch, the helicopter will move into position approximately 150 miles off the coast. Two and a half minutes after lift off, the first and second stages of the rocket will separate, with the latter carrying the payload to orbit. The first stage will descend back to Earth. It will deploy a drogue parachute at an altitude of 13 km (8.3 miles) and its main parachute at an altitude of roughly 6 km (3.7 miles).</p><p>The Sikorsky S-92 helicopter will then attempt to retrieve the stage by snagging a hook onto the parachute line. If all goes as planned, Rocket Lab will analyze the stage to see if it's suitable for another launch. Rocket Lab has carried out three successful recoveries of Electron's first stage from the ocean on previous missions. </p><p>\"Trying to catch a rocket as it falls back to Earth is no easy feat, we’re absolutely threading the needle here, but pushing the limits with such complex operations is in our DNA,\" Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck said in <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220405005568/en/Rocket-Lab-to-Attempt-First-Mid-Air-Helicopter-Capture-of-the-Electron-Rocket-During-Next-Mission\"><ins>a press release</ins></a>. \"We expect to learn a tremendous amount from the mission as we work toward the ultimate goal of making Electron the first reusable orbital small sat launcher and providing our customers with even more launch availability.”</p><p>The company first tested the mid-air retrieval process in March 2020, when it dropped a first stage from one helicopter and another <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rocket-lab-helicopter-catches-electron-stage-195637764.html\">successfully snagged the parachute</a> on the first attempt.

To protect essential reporting on the war, some exceptions apply under this guidance where there is a compelling public interest or newsworthy POW content.”</p><div id=\"f4125eccd7c04246ab837ad99eaba6f6\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Beginning today, we will require the removal of Tweets  posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts which share media that depict prisoners of war in the context of the war in Ukraine. <a href=\"https://t.co/WJ336RM8Gz\">https://t.co/WJ336RM8Gz</a>.</p>— Yoel Roth (@yoyoel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1511374455297089542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>In a blog post, the company added that in cases in which there is a “compelling public interest” for a government account to share photos of prisoners of war, it would add interstitial warnings to the images.</p><p>While the new rules apply to official government and government-affiliated accounts, Twitter noted that it will take down POW photos shared by anyone with “with abusive intent, such as insults, calls for retaliation, mocking/taking pleasure in suffering of PoWs, or for any other behavior that violates the Twitter rules.”</p><p>Additionally, Twitter is taking new steps to limit the reach of Russian government accounts on its platform. Under a new policy, the company will no longer “amplify or recommend government accounts belonging to states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict,” Roth said. “This measure drastically reduces the chance that people on Twitter see Tweets from these accounts unless they follow them.”</p><p>It’s not yet clear if or how Twitter plans to enforce this policy for contexts other than the war in Ukraine. In a blog post, the company left open the possibility that it would apply the rules to situations “beyond interstate armed conflict” but didn’t elaborate.</p><div id=\"81e2576e4ff9410fa4ba5f6cf8e5e544\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What does this mean?<br><br>We won’t recommend these accounts, and we won't amplify them across the Home Timeline, Explore, Search, and in other places on Twitter.

The company has already taken steps to limit the visibility of Russian <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-labeling-tweets-from-russian-state-media-outlets-175740062.html\">state media</a> outlets and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-pausing-ads-and-recommendations-in-ukraine-and-russia-004617413.html\">turned off</a> advertising and recommendations in both Russia and Ukraine.

This won't always cover the full tip and suggests earlier initiatives (such as requiring feedback on zero-tip orders) weren't effective, but should prevent couriers from suffering particularly severe financial blows.</p><p>The company is also making it easier for shoppers to collect their tips by shrinking the cash-out window from 24 hours to just two. The platform is also rolling out a previously-tested prompt that asks customers to consider increasing their tips when they give shoppers five-star ratings. This has led to a slight 6 percent increase in average shopper earnings during the pilot phase, Instacart claimed.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The tipping changes come alongside new batch types that let shoppers make the most of their travel time. Multi-store batches let them pick up orders from numerous locations, and they can accept new customers' orders while they're already in a store, not just before they start shopping. They might not miss out on as many income opportunities, to put it another way.</p><p>The additions are part of a four-month improvement plan for Instacart shoppers that includes live phone support and in-store app navigation features introduced in March.  More upgrades are coming over the next two months, Instacart said,</p><p>The additions come as Instacart faces pressure on multiple fronts. Legislators called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate tip baiting <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senators-ask-ftc-to-investigate-instacart-tip-baiting-175932563.html\">back in 2020</a>, and they've been pushing for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senate-bill-portable-benefits-025251733.html\">greater benefits for gig workers</a> in recent months. The company has also faced <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instacart-lays-off-1900-workers-212548589.html\">unionization efforts</a>, and the move toward <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kroger-delivery-now-instacart-141006383.html\">ever-faster deliveries</a> hasn't exactly been gentle on shoppers. In theory, at least, these latest changes will address the complaints and keep shoppers from working for rival services.</p>",

				"description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-unreal-engine-5-demo-150044561.html\">Unreal Engine 5</a> is finally here after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-early-access-152553496.html\">nearly a year</a> of early access. Epic Games has officially <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/feed\">released</a> UE5 to developers, promising both more photorealistic visuals and easier-to-use creator tools. </p><p>The new Unreal Engine's most obvious upgrades affect the basics of 3D rendering. The Nanite geometry system lets producers use objects with millions of polygons each while scaling gracefully and maintaining playable frame rates. Lumen, meanwhile, provides dynamic global lighting that adapts to everything from the time of day to a character's flashlight. You've seen early results in Epic's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-matrix-awakens-unreal-engine-5-interactive-demo-165501226.html\"><em>The Matrix Awakens</em></a> tech demo — UE5 can render extremely detailed scenes with more natural lighting than you might have seen in the past.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/cca9b130-b4eb-11ec-bff3-c068182be771\" style=\"height:1280;width:1920;\" alt=\"Unreal Engine 5 city sample\" data-uuid=\"64e8e937-f6ac-38ea-b191-470a1b7a2ee0\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Epic Games</div></figure><p>There are some behind-the-scenes improvements that should affect the games you play, too. It's now much easier for developers to make open-world games thanks to systems that both automatically divide areas (to make them easier to stream) and let multiple developers work on the same region at the same time. There are new and upgraded tools to create models, animations and audio without resorting to external editors, and companies making videos or still images can generate very high quality output that would normally require a time-consuming offline renderer.</p><p>It will take a while for content to use the new engine. At best, studios have had less than a year to test the engine and start work on their projects. Even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/black-myth-wukong-trailer-unreal-engine-5-dlss-144528378.html\"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> (one of the first announced Unreal Engine 5 titles) won't be available until 2023, and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cd-project-red-the-witcher-game-unreal-engine-5-174928261.html\">next Witcher game</a> doesn't have a release date. Still, the launch effectively sets the stage for the next wave of games <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-mandalorian-ilm-stagecraft-real-time-digital-sets.html\">and video special effects</a>. You could see a significant leap in realism from games that take better advantage of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html\">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html\">Xbox Series X</a>/<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-s-review-140027758.html\">S</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-price-135534339.html\">latest PC video cards</a>.</p>",

				"description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/vanmoof/\">VanMoof</a> is updating its core <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/e-bike/\">e-bike</a> lineup for the first time in two years. There are two new models designed for different use cases.</p><p>The company created the S5 with longer rides in mind. It reworked the straight frame to increase the height of the riding position. It's for riders between 165 and 210 cm tall (approximately 5'5\" to 6'11\"). There are larger, 27.5-inch wheels and the base e-bike weighs 23kg (51 lbs).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As for the A5, that's designed more for shorter trips and city rides. It has an angled frame with a lower step-in and it's for riders between 155 and 200 cm in height (roughly 5'1\" to 6'7\"). It has 24-inch wheels and weighs 22kg (48.5 lbs). There's support for both rear and front carriers as well</p><p>The front one is designed to carry up to 10kg (22 lbs) and has an elastic cord to secure items. Both bikes can be equipped with rear carriers. The regular rack is designed for loads up to 15kg (33 lbs), while the heavy-duty option should comfortably support up to 27kg (59.5 lbs).</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/d5130330-b4eb-11ec-ad7d-8118d010ef03\" alt=\"VanMoof S5 and A5 e-bikes with feature descriptions\" data-uuid=\"5ad173b1-d176-32cd-8a92-a5b69da3faf3\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">VanMoof</div></figure><p>VanMoof has upgraded the motor on both bikes as well. With the 250W, 5V Gen 5 motor, the company says these models will provide the smoothest rides around. The motor has an e-shifter, torque sensor and integrated battery. The improved Turbo Boost will provide 68 Nm of torque, compared with 59 Nm in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vanmoof-s3-electric-bicycle-review-123059628.html\">2020's S3</a>.</p><p>Both models have a 26-cell, 47V permanent battery, though there are slight differences. The S5 has a 487Wh capacity, while the A5's has a 463Wh capacity. At full power and in economy mode, the S5 will offer a range of up to 150 km (93 miles), while the A5 has a range of up to 140 km (87 miles). You can extend those by up to 140 km with the click-on battery.</p><p>Using the Gen 5 charger, you'll be able to charge the battery to 50 percent of capacity in two and a half hours and fully in six hours and 30 minutes. The speed charger shortens those times considerably. You'll be able to juice up your e-bike's battery to half capacity in an hour and to 100 percent in four and a half hours.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/67903bb0-b4ec-11ec-bf7d-a00180165918\" alt=\"VanMoof\" data-uuid=\"898d8dcb-36d1-3aea-b761-d2e587833f78\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">VanMoof</div></figure><p>New to the S5 and A5 is a halo ring interface with LED display integrated in the handlebar. There's a phone mount with a USB-C charging port too.</p><p>The anti-theft tech includes a Gen 5 kick lock that you can arm with a tap of your foot. It'll unlock automatically when you return. VanMoof is working on certification for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/find%20my/\">Apple Find My</a> support, and it'll continue to employ its Bike Hunters. If that team can't find and recover your bike within two weeks of it being lost or stolen, it will send you a replacement.</p><p>The S5 and A5 are both pricier than the S3 and X3, which cost $2,448. They'll each cost $2,998/£2,298/€2,498. The company didn't mention when it'll ship the new models.</p>",

				"description": "<div id=\"4a351d85bffe4ddd97e4ee8d23a9e376\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgLjz_SGDAw?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div><p>With Sony and Canon dominating headlines, Nikon has been the forgotten company in the mirrorless race. That’s set to change, though, with the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nikon-officially-unveils-the-45-megapixel-z-9-with-8-k-video-and-20-fps-burst-speeds-125237569.html\">45.7-megapixel Z9</a>. It’s an innovative professional camera that offers awesome speed, incredible detail and outstanding 8K video capabilities.</p><p>Nikon is breaking some new ground with this camera, too. It’s the first mirrorless model with no mechanical shutter, relying instead on a fast sensor to minimize the jello effect that can happen with an electronic shutter.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Z9 is not without some flaws, though. It’s quite heavy compared to rival models like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html\">Sony’s A1</a> and the lack of a fully articulating screen makes it a hard sell for videographers. At <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$5,500 for the body only\" href=\"https://fave.co/3uXGCs4\">$5,500 for the body only</a>, it’s quite expensive — let’s see how it measures up to the competition.</p><h2>Design and handling</h2><h3></h3><p>The Z9 is, honestly, a chunky camera. It weighs around 1,340 grams, or just 60 grams less than Nikon’s D6 DSLR. By contrast, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r3-camera-reivew-143057327.html\">Canon EOS R3</a> weighs 1,015 grams and Sony’s A1 is a mere 737 grams. A camera that heavy can be fatiguing but then again, many professional photographers prefer big, heavy cameras for stability.</p><p>The large size meant Nikon could include a nice big grip that imparts a feeling of security, particularly with a big lens attached. Like Canon’s EOS R3, you can rotate it 90 degrees and get matching controls and a grip, allowing for easy operation in portrait mode.</p><p>The Z9 has a generous array of manual controls, but I’m not a big fan of the layout. The AF button is positioned on the left side next to the lens, which I find awkward. The top display also takes up space that could’ve been used for more buttons. On the plus side, it has a large number of programmable buttons, so you can set it up the way you like. If you’re a longtime Nikon user, you might enjoy the layout more than I did.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid=\"ae182309-aeed-457c-8b76-197d8dc5e9b0\"/><p>Compared to Sony and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/panasonics-25-megapixel-gh-6-is-the-highest-resolution-micro-four-thirds-camera-yet-010021527.html\">Panasonic</a>’s latest cameras, the menu system is a bit too complicated. Rather than dividing things into subcategories, you have to scroll down for a while on certain menus to find what you need. Your best bet to avoid any hassle is to program the custom menus and buttons to do what you need.</p><p>With 2.09 million dots, the 3.2-inch touchscreen is relatively sharp and bright, but there are a few drawbacks. As mentioned, it only tilts up and out to the right, so self-shooting or vlogging is impossible unless you have an external display. Sony’s A1 also lacked a fully articulating display, but Canon has finally included one in its professional EOS R3 model.</p><p>The EVF’s resolution is a bit disappointing for a camera this expensive, at just 3.69 million dots, compared to 9.44 million on the Sony A1. Considering the high-res sensor, that seems like a miss. On the plus side, it uses “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oxbwto0N2s\">Dual-Stream</a>” tech to send data to the sensor and EVF simultaneously. As a result, you get blackout-free performance during all shooting, and according to Nikon, that comes with zero frame skipping or repeating. That’s likely a light dig at some Sony cameras, which drop the EVF resolution under certain shooting conditions.</p><p>Nikon has gone all-in on CFexpress for the Z9, with two CFexpress and no SD card slots. This is smart for a couple of reasons. There’s no compromise on speed for burst shooting or video, which is crucial for high frame rates required for ProRes HQ and, down the road, RAW video. It also means that professional shooters can record to two cards at once for a backup, with no compromise on speed. The downside, of course, is that CFexpress and XQD cards are much more <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1548489-REG/prograde_digital_pgcfx650gcpbh_digital_650gb_cfexpress_2_0.html\">expensive</a> than SD cards.</p><p>Other features include a huge EN-EL18D battery that delivers a solid 740 shots on a charge and over two hours of 4K video, as well as backward compatibility with D6 and other Nikon pro DSLR batteries. It also comes with a USB-C 3.2 slot for both transfers and storage, mic and headphone jacks, an Ethernet port for remote shooting and a full-sized HDMI jack. While the Z9 doesn’t have a mechanical shutter, it does have a cover to protect the sensor when you change lenses.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/80f6c440-b364-11ec-95ff-50618aaded85\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 mirrorless camera review\" data-uuid=\"e93d3523-2f65-3718-ad54-9e15134a7560\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Z9 is Nikon’s fastest mirrorless camera to date. You can shoot up to 20 RAW frames per second at full resolution, 30 JPEGs or a blindingly-fast 120 JPEGS per second at a lower11-MP resolution. Again, all of those speeds are in electronic shutter mode, because there’s no mechanical shutter. You can, of course, shoot in silent mode, or activate a simulated shutter sound if you really need to hear that “click.”</p><p>That’s fast, but I managed just 40 lossless RAW photos with a very fast CFexpress card before the buffer filled. If you’re fine using the lossy “high-efficiency” modes, however, you can shoot anywhere from 70 to nearly infinite photos without stopping.</p><p>The hybrid phase-detect autofocus is a big improvement over the last model, too. Nikon has brought 3D tracking over from its DSLRs, but it’s far better in the Z9 because it has 493 AF tracking points, far more than the others have.</p><p>It delivers very reliable subject tracking most of the time. Normally, you just set the tracking point on an athlete or other fast-moving subject, and the AF will keep them in focus. Occasionally, it will drop the subject and focus on the background or something else, particularly with birds or other fast objects. In general, it works as well or nearly as well as the subject-tracking AF on Sony’s latest A1 and A7 IV models.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/80d3abe0-b364-11ec-bf7b-449612152dff\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 mirrorless camera review\" data-uuid=\"2318570f-e669-32e3-b7dd-1c1a23dd32e5\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The new face, eye, vehicle and animal detection is incredibly fast and accurate as well, even if the subject is a good distance away. In fact, the Z9 can recognize nine types of subjects automatically: human eyes, faces, heads and upper bodies; animal eyes, heads and bodies; and cars, planes, trains and motorbikes. I didn’t have a chance to test all of those, but for several different subjects, even at high burst speeds, most of my shots were in focus.</p><p>With no mechanical shutter, fast readout speeds are key to reducing skew and other issues. Happily, the Z9’s stacked, backside-illuminated CMOS sensor is up to the job. I never saw any rolling shutter unless I really whipped the camera around. So even for sports or bird photography, you’re not likely to see any issues.</p><p>At the same time, the 5-axis in-body stabilization reduces blurry shots due to camera movement or hand shake. The six stops of shake reduction are well below the Canon EOS R3’s 8 stops, however.</p><h2>Image quality</h2><core-slideshow data-slideshowid=\"30d88e72-47ae-4b50-bb03-d79ab2471475\"/><p>With 45.7 megapixels on tap, the Z9 delivers sharp images with very high dynamic range. In fact, next to all rivals, it’s second only to Nikon’s own Z7 II, which is the current dynamic range champion and packs a similar sensor. All RAW images are now captured with 14-bit color depth, giving you plenty of room to tweak them in Adobe Lightroom or Nikon’s NX Studio.</p><p>Color accuracy is better than I’ve seen on previous models, possibly thanks to the Nikon Z9’s new Expeed 7 processor that brings improvements to white balance. However, skin tones aren’t quite as warm as with Canon’s R3 or R5. JPEG images look nice straight out of the camera, though they can be slightly over-sharpened with the default settings.</p><p>The Z9 has a wide ISO range of 64-25,600, expandable to 32-102,400. The low 64 setting is nice to have in bright sunlight if you want to avoid completely closing down the iris (which can hurt image quality). It performs pretty well in low-light, too. Grain is well-controlled up to about ISO 6,400, and shots are usable at ISO 12,800. Beyond that, noise starts to get distracting. The Z9 is about the same as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html\">Canon’s R5</a> in that regard, but not up to the level of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-07-sony-a7r-iv-review.html\">Sony’s A7R IV</a> or A1.</p><section data-eng-breakout=\"09c2366ef6c147e39e31a4ece3316b67\" data-eng-breakout-type=\"e2ehero\"><img class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/2af4e731-b363-11ec-bfeb-1e815413bab3\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 review sample images\"></section><p></p><h2>Video</h2><h3></h3><p>The Z9 is Nikon’s most competent video camera to date, and by far. For starters, it can record 8K H.265 for up to two hours without any overheating or other issues. That’s something Canon’s smaller EOS R5 can’t do, though it is $1,600 cheaper. The Z9 can shoot very sharp 4K at up to 30 fps by oversampling the full width of the sensor, and up to 120 fps with continuous autofocus and sound.</p><p>Right now, you can record 4K using ProRes 4:2:2 HQ, a widely used format that creates large files, but is easy to edit. It also records in H.265 10-bit mode for 8K and 4K video. Meanwhile, Nikon’s N-Log mode lets you max out dynamic range, so you can easily adjust shadows and highlights when editing.</p><p>There’s more to come, though. In a future firmware update, Nikon will offer 8K 60p internal RAW video using a format called <a href=\"https://www.intopix.com/blogs/post/TicoRAW-technology-added-with-High-Efficiency-RAW-recording-of-Nikon-Z-9-flagship-mirrorless-camera\">TicoRaw</a>. When it arrives later this year, it’ll let you capture 11 minutes of lossless 12-bit 8K RAW video and 54 minutes of visually lossless 8K to a 1TB card.</p><p>As with photos, video autofocus is fast, reliable and can track a subject’s face even if they’re fairly far away. It also follows subjects smoothly when they’re moving toward the camera, though you may have to tweak the AF speed. Unfortunately, the only way to find or use that setting is to dive into the menus. Hopefully, Nikon will let you assign it to a button in a future upgrade.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/b3dcdb62-b364-11ec-bdf7-ff7d98dfeef8\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 mirrorless camera review\" data-uuid=\"6c89e920-5e3f-39a9-9c62-364a77312cd3\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Rolling shutter is more prominent in video than stills, particularly at the 8K and 4K oversampled resolutions. However, it’s still not nearly as bad on some cameras (looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html\">Sony’s A7 IV</a>) thanks to the extremely fast sensor readout speeds. It’s not even really noticeable unless you whip-pan the camera or have a fast-moving subject.</p><p>8K and 4K oversampled video is extremely sharp. Quality drops a hair at the higher frame rate 4K settings, when pixel-binning kicks in, but it’s nothing you’d notice unless you’re looking for it. Colors are accurate, but again, skin tones aren’t quite as pretty as on Canon’s latest models.</p><p>Dynamic range is also top notch, particularly in the 400-800 ISO range in ProRes mode, making it easy to adjust shadows and highlights in post. If you love shooting ProRes footage, be sure to get some high-capacity CFexpress cards, because the file sizes can get huge; they take around 132GB for 10 minutes of 4K 60p ProRes HQ footage.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/2af4e734-b363-11ec-b7f3-74ec62d47777\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 review sample images\" data-uuid=\"a6f18904-1f00-3d36-b7e7-0bdf45a6708a\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Z9\" href=\"https://fave.co/3uXGCs4\">Z9</a> is Nikon’s most versatile and powerful mirrorless camera yet, and the lack of a mechanical shutter is a non-issue. It’s particularly strong for video, and will be a powerhouse once the RAW video firmware update arrives. However, Nikon’s decision to not use a fully articulating screen is a shame, considering all this awesome video capability.</p><p>The Z9’s main rival is Sony’s $6,500 A1, which offers similar shooting speeds, resolution and video capabilities. The Z9 is $1,000 cheaper and will (eventually) have higher 8K frame rates with the upcoming firmware update. However, your choice may come down to whether you prefer Sony or Nikon’s camera systems.</p><p>Another option is Canon’s $6,000 EOS R3. With just a 24-MP sensor, though, it’s designed primarily for sports, so it’s not ideal for studio or landscape work. Overall, the Z9 is a great choice for pros who don’t want to compromise on any kind of shooting, whether that’s photos or video.</p>",
